  <h2>How to Care for Your Jewellery </h2>
</div>
</header>

<h3>General Care:</h3>
<p>
A professional should regularly check jewellery for damage or wear. If you 
have any concerns about your jewellery condition, take it to your local member of the NAJ.<br> They will 
take great pride in helping you keep yours looking as good as the day it was bought. Here are a few tips
 on some of the things you can do to keep it in great shape:

<ul>
  <li>Take your jewellery off if you're involved in any activity which could scratch,
 knock or damage it. If in any doubt, take it off and keep it safe.</li>

  <li>Keep it well away from chemicals, especially chlorine. If it does
 come into contact with chemicals, rinse it in water immediately.</li>

  <li>Bathe and apply any lotions or perfumes before you put your jewellery on. 
Organic gemstones like pearls and opals are particularly vulnerable to acids, even perspiration.</li>

  <li>Store it separately, ideally in a soft-lined box or case, so that your favourite pieces don't tangle, 
rub or scratch one another. Pearls in particular should be kept separately <br>as they are easily scratched by hard gemstones.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>Jewellery MOT:</h3>
<p>
Make sure you have a detailed insurance valuation for your jewellery. As a rough guide, the description in a professional jewellery<br> valuation will be detailed 
enough that a jeweller could use it to draw a pretty accurate sketch of the item. The NAJ has registered valuers located within the UK.<br>

If in doubt about the care, repair or valuation of your jewellery, then seek the advice of an NAJ member. For the sign of a professional<br> jeweller, 
look for the National Association of Jewellers' Grant-of-Arms, which identifies retail jewellery shops around the UK that have been vetted by the NAJ.
<br>
Here's a quick checklist of some of the things to look out for:

<ul>
  <li> Worn, damaged or missing claws on settings risk losing stones </li>

  <li> Loose stones in their setting   </li>

  <li>  Loose catches and clasps or rough links on chains or bracelets   </li>

  <li>  Any fractures in metals   </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Gemstone Cleaning:</h3>
<p>
Gemstones are bought for their sparkle and colour, so it's essential to keep them looking their best. However, 
it is important to<br>  know what type of gem you are cleaning and how to get it back to looking like new.<br>
<br>
Many coloured gemstones have been treated to enhance their appearance. These treatments can negatively interact with
 some cleaning <br> products and damage the jewellery. If in any doubt, take your jewellery to a jeweller for advice.<br>
<br>
Although a gemstone may appear tough, many can be susceptible to heat. Whenever cleaning, make sure that you use warm water 
rather than hot or<br> boiling water. Inclusions within gemstones can weaken their structure if aggressively cleaned. Gemstones, such as
 emeralds that have been<br> oiled to improve colour, can be negatively affected by mechanical cleaning such as steam and ultrasonic cleaning.<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>Diamond Cleaning:</h3>
<p>
Despite being the hardest naturally occurring substance on Earth, diamonds require care and attention. They are hard,<br>
 but they can still fracture and be scratched by other diamonds due to their directional hardness. Oil deposits from <br>
 fingers and general dust and grime can quickly adhere to the diamond surface and affect a diamond's brilliance.
<br><br>
Handle the diamond carefully and store it away from other jewellery to avoid scratching the other pieces, including <br>
other diamond jewellery. Keeping the diamond in individual small plastic bags or a fabric-lined case will help <br>
reduce damage, wear and a build-up of dirt.
